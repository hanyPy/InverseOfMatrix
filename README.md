# InverseOfMatrix
I'd rather spend 2 hours on this instead of 5 minutes  of solving it by hand tbh.

The idea just came to me as I was about to study some math, and I just kinda did it.
I was definetly confused at first, I learned that i need to remember that variables could have the same name but different valeus, which is why i changed them into "Cnm" at one point.
This was definetly good practice for me.
